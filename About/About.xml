  <description>Fixes a bug with vanilla Sarcophagi

Basically if you create a masterwork or legendary sarcophagi (even modded ones) it will try to create an art description before you bury someone which it shouldn't do because there are already measures in place to make sure it doesn't generate an art description upon artwork initialization.
    
Untested with any mods that change how quality works, but as long as none of them overwrite the function "SendCraftNotification" it should be fine.

Tested and works with:
- Crafting Quality Rebalanced
- Mad Skills
- Quality Builder
- Utility Columns</description>
